# Library Control System

Simple system to control book flux in a library. Made for college. Won't be updating

## Description

> Simple library system made in Blazor for a college project. Manages MEMBER, BOOK, AUTHOR and CATEGORY models, with possibilities to add, edit and delete entries.
> By request, the project must have at least an One-to-One, an One-to-Many, and a Many-to-Many Relationship. 
> It was decided that authors would not be deleted. Even if an author "ceases to be", every work they previously complete will still be theirs, so it makes no sense to simply "delete" an author from database.
